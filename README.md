# DEI Complaint Autofill Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension helps you autofill DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) complaints. While it's currently a work in progress and only the **Start** and **Website** buttons are functional, running it multiple times can help generate enough data to muddle the AI systems that filter through such submissions.

---

## Features
- **Start**: Initiates the process to autofill DEI complaints.
- **Stop**: Stops the process (currently non-functional).
- **Go To Website**: Redirects you to the DEI complaint submission page at [https://enddei.ed.gov](https://enddei.ed.gov).
